      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Studying</strong>: I'm currently reading <em
              >Writing An Interpreter in Go</em
            > by Thorsten Ball. It's been incredibly fun—I'm learning a lot about
            interpreters and deepening my overall understanding of programming. Easily
            one of the most engaging technical books I've read.
          </p>

            <strong>Work</strong>: I'm nearing the end of my probation period at
            my new job. Things have been pretty hectic, but I'm starting to
            settle in and feel more at ease with the workflow. The learning
            curve was steep, but it's starting to pay off.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Reading</strong>: I just wrapped up <em>Dark Mirror</em> by Barton
            Gellman. A solid read with an interesting look at the Snowden leaks from
            a journalist's perspective.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Gaming</strong>: Playing <em>Mafia: Definitive Edition</em> right
            now. Picked it up during a Steam sale and it's been a pleasant surprise—solid
            story and atmosphere. Old-school but good.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Fitness</strong>: I've just started running again, aiming to
            build up my endurance. I'm also doing bodyweight exercises at
            home—nothing fancy, just trying to stay consistent and gradually get
            stronger. The combo's been great for stamina and mental clarity.
