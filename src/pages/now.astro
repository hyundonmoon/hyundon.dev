      on at this point in their life.

            <strong>Travel</strong>: I just got back from a four-day trip to
            Shanghai. The food was amazing, I spent a day at Disneyland with my
            friends, and I even got to practice speaking Chinese with the
            locals.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Studying</strong>: I'm revisiting TypeScript and exploring
            some of its newer features. I'm also taking a shot at learning Goâ€”I
            recently found a fascinating book on building compilers in Go, and I
            want to dive into it.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Work</strong>: I got the chance to interview at one of my
            dream companies, and now I'm waiting to hear back. Very grateful for
            the opportunity and excited about what's next.
