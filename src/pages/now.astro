            <strong>Work</strong>: I got a new job! I started working at NHN
            Dooray in March. My first two weeks have been greatâ€”I've already
            learned so much, and the people I work with are really nice. Looking
            forward to growing here.
          </p>

            <strong>Studying</strong>: My first assignment at work was to add a
            new feature to a legacy codebase from 5-6 years ago. Turns out, the
            original developer was really into functional programming, so I've
            been diving into core FP concepts like functors and monads to better
            understand the codebase.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Reading</strong>: For work, I've been reading Luis Atencio's
            <em>Functional Programming in JavaScript</em>. For fun, I've been
            reading <em>Storm Front</em> by Jim Butcher on my commute.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Gaming</strong>: I just started playing <em
              >Chrono Trigger</em
            >
            on my Nintendo 3DS XL. I had a great time playing <em
              >Dragon Quest XI</em
            >
            on my Switch, so I'm hoping this one will be just as fun.
