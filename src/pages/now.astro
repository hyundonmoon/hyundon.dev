            <strong>Learning</strong>: Spent the Lunar New Year holiday diving deep into garbage collection concepts after realizing I couldn't answer interview questions about memory management well. Wrote detailed notes on reference counting, mark-and-sweep algorithms, and how JavaScript handles memory automatically.

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>React Internals</strong>: Continued my exploration of React Hooks by studying <code>useEffect</code> and understanding why hook order matters. Previously dug into <code>useState</code> source code to understand the linked list structure React uses to manage hooks.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Technical Writing</strong>: Publishing notes on fundamental JavaScript and React concepts, focusing on understanding not just the "how" but the "why" behind the APIs we use daily.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Growth</strong>: Using interview experiences as learning opportunities—when I don't know something well enough, I study it thoroughly and document what I learn.
